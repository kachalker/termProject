        <p class="text-center">My entire life, I've lived in Cobb County, a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. When I was four, I moved from East Cobb to West Cobb and have lived at the base of the Civil War battlefield, Kennesaw Mountain, ever since.</p>

        <p class="text-center">After completing my undergraduate degree at W&L, my next goal is to be accepted at Harvard law school. If I accomplish this goal, in five years, I will be in my second year of law school at Harvard.</p>

        <p class="text-center">My name is Kaitlyn Chalker and I'm a member of the class of 2024 at Washington and Lee University. I'm on the women's varsity tennis team here at W&L and I'm a part of the LEAD program.</p>

        <p class="text-center">Growing up by Kennesaw Mountain was what first sparked my interest in history. That interest was further fostered by my dad who is a history buff. Now, I love history so much that it is my intended major at W&L.</p>
